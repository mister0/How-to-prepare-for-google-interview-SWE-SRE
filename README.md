# How to prepare for Google's interview for the positions : Software Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer

This repository includes resources which are more than sufficient to prepare for google's interview if you are applying for a software engineer or a site reliability engineer position

Sections in this repository : 
1. [General guidelines](#general-guidelines-quick-reading-before-you-start-) : this section contains resources to understand how the interviewing process should look like and what to expect in general
2. [Algorithms & Data structure](#algorithms-practice-everyday--for-as-much-time-as-you-can) : The most important section, specially the starred list items, try to practice at least 3 problems and read 1 topic
everyday, also try to increase the difficulty of the problems you solve by time, don't stick to easy problems because usually interview problems are medium and hard ones.
3. [System design and architecture](#system-design-and-architecture-) : if you have this as a part of your interviewing process (ask your recruiter) then make sure to finish the starred list items (the most important ones) and then divide the rest according to your time.
4. [Operating systems and programming concepts](#os-and-programming-concepts-) : no more description than the title !
5. [Site reliability engineer books](#for-sre-interview--site-reliability-engineer-books-) : in case your interview is for a site reliability engineer position ... these books are useful but not necessary.
6. [Extra links](#extra-links-if-you-finished-already-what-was-mentioned-before-and-still-have-time-) : these are bonus resources (most of them are algorithm and data structure related) in case you have more time to practice :)

My general advice is to allocate 70% of your time for algorithm and data structure practice, 25% for system design readings (if the recruiter told you you will have it in your interviewing process) and 5% for other topics or readings.
I marked non-free resources with Money emoji :money_with_wings:, you can be super well prepared without them, but I strongly recommend Leetcode subscription.
I also marked the "must" TODO items with star emoji :star:, so make sure to put them in your top priority.
